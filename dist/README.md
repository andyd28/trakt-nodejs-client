# trakt-typed-api (WIP)

A typed API wrapper for Node.js to access the Trakt.tv API.

The wrapper is grouped and listed in the same manner as the API documentation and contains the interfaces for the arguments required for each method.

The API documentation will give the details on what is returned from each method, adding these interfaces is a work in process.

This is updated in my free time so any fixes may not be instant;

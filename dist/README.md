# trakt-typed-api (WIP)
A typed API wrapper for Node.js to access the Trakt.tv API.

The wrapper is grouped and listed in the same manner as the API documentation and contains the interfaces for the arguments required for each method.

The API documentation will give the details on what is returned from each method, adding these interfaces is a work in process;

## Futher development will include

 - [ ] Types for common objects such as 'movie', 'show' etc.
 - [ ] Interfaces for the return objects of each method.
 - [ ] Examples of use, notably how to create and authorise the API.
 - [ ] Addition of error trapping with exception message.
